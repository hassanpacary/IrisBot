        Command for the bot Iris to join a voice channel.

        Functionality:
        - Checks if the user invoking the command is connected to a voice channel.
        - If the user is not in a voice channel, sends an ephemeral warning message.
        - Checks if the bot is already connected to a voice channel.
        - If the bot is already in the same channel as the user, sends an ephemeral message indicating it is already connected.
        - If the bot is connected to a different channel, moves the bot to the user's channel and sends an ephemeral confirmation message.
        - If the bot is not connected to any voice channel, it joins the user's channel and sends an ephemeral confirmation message.

        Parameters:
        - interaction (discord.Interaction): The Interaction object representing the slash command invoked by the user.

        Behavior:
        - Safely handles cases where the user is not in a voice channel or the bot is not connected.
        - All confirmation messages are sent ephemerally to avoid spamming the channel.
